# React test runners performance benchmark

We recently introduced Ava in our codebase and we found that the more React
components we tested, the slower the tests became (`~120s` for one hundred tests).

So, I created this benchmark to compare the React test runners performance.

This is far from being scientific and the goal is not to make a ranking.

There are a lot of wonderful open source tools nowadays and we just have to find
the right one for our project.
